This python3 script mimics a hardware usb mouse jiggler

screen is seen as quadrants...

   one   ||  two
  ===============
  three  ||  four

when mouse is in quadrant one jiggling will work when the mouse is moved to any other quadrant it stops jiggling

daftie wee program as I lost my hardware jiggler!!
